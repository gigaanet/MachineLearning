Commit ID: 0ce3d31
Description:
This submodule serves as your entry point into the world of machine learning. It introduces you to Google Colab, an online platform that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser, and Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
Content: You will learn how to set up your Colab environment, read and write datasets, and perform basic data analysis tasks using Pandas. The exercises will include importing datasets, cleaning data, and exploring data structures like DataFrames.
Goal: By the end of this module, you’ll be comfortable using Colab and Pandas to prepare data for further analysis.
2. Regression Model Representation
Commit ID: 6f539c1
Description:
This module dives into the concept of regression, a foundational technique in machine learning used for predicting continuous outcomes.
Content: You’ll learn about different types of regression models, including linear regression and polynomial regression. The submodule includes practical examples where you will build regression models and visualize their performance using various metrics.
Goal: You will gain the skills to interpret regression outputs and understand how to apply regression analysis to real-world problems.
3. Logistic Regression
Commit ID: 61e195a
Description:
Building on the regression concepts, this module introduces logistic regression, a statistical method used for binary classification problems.
Content: You’ll explore how logistic regression works, including the logistic function and how to interpret coefficients. Practical exercises will guide you through implementing logistic regression on datasets, enabling you to classify binary outcomes.
Goal: By the end of this submodule, you’ll be equipped to apply logistic regression to solve classification problems and understand the underlying mechanics.
4. SVM Classification and Regression
Commit ID: a17ea52
Description:
This module focuses on Support Vector Machines (SVM), a versatile and powerful tool for both classification and regression tasks.
Content: You’ll learn the theory behind SVM, including concepts like hyperplanes and support vectors. Practical exercises will allow you to implement SVM on various datasets and compare its performance with other classification methods.
Goal: By the conclusion of this module, you’ll have a solid understanding of SVM and be able to apply it effectively to different types of problems.
5. Decision Tree Classifier
Commit ID: 590e82a
Description:
The final submodule introduces you to decision trees, a popular method for classification and regression due to their intuitive and interpretable nature.
Content: You’ll learn how decision trees work, how to build them, and how to visualize the decision-making process. The module includes hands-on exercises where you’ll create decision trees from scratch and evaluate their performance.
Goal: By the end of this module, you will understand how to use decision trees for classification tasks and how to tune their parameters for optimal performance.
